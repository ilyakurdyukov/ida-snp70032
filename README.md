## Sonix SNP70032 support for IDA 7.x

Place the `snp70032.py` in the `procs` directory.
If you don't see "Sonix SNP70032 (snp70032)" in the CPU selection, then check if Python support is working in IDA.

* The developers from Sonix replaced some assembler commands with expressions, I converted it to classic assembler.
